<h3>Overview</h3>
<div> Recent advances in natural language generation
  have led to the development of models capable
  of generating high-quality and human-like texts
  among many languages and domains. However,
  it is known that such models can be misused
  for malicious purposes, including but not limited to generating fake news, spreading propaganda, and facilitating fraud. This tutorial aims
  at bringing awareness of artificial text detection,
  a fast-growing niche field devoted to mitigating
  the misuse of these models. It targets NLP researchers and industrial practitioners who work
  with text generative models and/or on mitigating ethical, social, and privacy harms. Our
  tutorial provides the attendees with a comprehensive background on this topic and reviews
  in a holistic manner: (1) issues of generative
  models that can exacerbate their misuse, (2)
  terminologies and task definitions, (3) models
  well-studied for the task, (4) existing datasets
  and benchmarks, (5) approaches to detecting
  generated texts, (6) standard crowd-sourcing
  practices and related critical studies, (7) downstream applications, and (8) established risks
  of harm. We conclude by outlining unresolved
  methodological problems and future work directions.</div>
